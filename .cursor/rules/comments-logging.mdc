description: comments & logging
alwaysApply: true

- `src/customLib/logger/logger.ts` should always be used instead of comments
- use `logger.info` rarely
- use `logger.verbose` for big steps
- use `logger.silly` for very small steps or steps that repeat often (e.g. in loops)
- comments should start in lowercase
- when logging using the `src/customLib/logger/` library, only the string in the first argument is logged, so the second argument should not be used for that purpose
