- for every change TypeScript errors need to be checked and minimized
- for every change ESLint errors need to be checked and minimized
- after every change, eslint should be run with `--fix` so a lot of small errors can be fixed automatically
- after every change, prettier should be run with `--write` so a lot of small formatting mistakes can be fixed automatically
- first TypeScript errors should be fixed, then ESLint errors, then prettier errors
