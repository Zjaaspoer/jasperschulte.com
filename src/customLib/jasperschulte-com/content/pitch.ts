  elevatorPitch: `I'm an Engineering Leader with over 20 years of experience scaling technology organizations and platforms across enterprises, hypergrowth scale-ups, and startups. I've led engineering teams of 10 to 150+ people at Booking.com, Getir, Tripadvisor, SnappCar, and beyond—helping organizations grow from a few dozen to hundreds of engineers while keeping delivery speed, quality, and culture intact.

My sweet spot is building scalable solutions for complex problems: from modernizing core platforms at one of the world's highest-traffic websites, to structuring engineering teams during hypergrowth, to setting up sustainable practices in scale-ups with a few hundred employees. I combine technical depth with organizational leadership, enabling companies to ship faster, build resilient systems, and unlock long-term value.

What sets me apart is how I lead: with transparency, trust, and clarity. I make complex transformations tangible, coach future leaders, and create cultures where teams feel empowered to own their outcomes. Outside of work, I'm also a public speaker at international conferences, sharing insights on platform architecture, engineering culture, and scaling organizations.

I offer my services primarily as a fractional or interim engineering leader—helping organizations navigate growth, transformation, and scale. I’m also open to permanent opportunities where the circumstances and fit are right. If you're facing complex challenges in engineering, product, or platform, I'd love to connect.`,
